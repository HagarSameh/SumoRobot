# Sumo Robot Project: C++ Arduino Code for Advanced Attack and Defense Strategies
Welcome to the Sumo Robot project repository! This project showcases the development of intelligent Sumo Robots programmed in C++ using Arduino. The goal of this project is to create competitive Sumo Robots equipped with advanced attack and defense strategies, enhancing their capabilities for engaging in thrilling Sumo wrestling battles.

## Project Overview
The Sumo Robots in this project are equipped with a set of 4 ultrasonic sensors and 4 IR sensors, precisely positioned to provide accurate proximity detection and situational awareness. Leveraging the power of Arduino programming in C++, we have developed sophisticated code that enables these robots to make intelligent decisions based on sensor inputs.

## Attack and Defense Strategies
One of the key highlights of this project is the implementation of two distinct strategies for attacking and defending. The robots are programmed to execute strategic maneuvers based on sensor data interpretation, enabling them to outmaneuver opponents and outwit their moves.

The attacking strategy allows the Sumo Robots to identify opponents within the Sumo ring and employ aggressive tactics to force them out of the arena. On the other hand, the defense strategy empowers the robots to react swiftly to incoming attacks, utilizing sensor inputs to dodge or withstand opposing forces effectively.

## Collaboration and Development
This project has been a collaborative effort, bringing together a dedicated team of robotics enthusiasts. Our team worked closely, focusing on code development, sensor integration, and rigorous testing. The collaborative environment fostered effective communication, efficient problem-solving, and a shared commitment to achieving high-performance Sumo Robots.

## Repository Contents
